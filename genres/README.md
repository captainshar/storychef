# Genre Modules

These modules provide genre-specific interview layers, craft frameworks, and editorial considerations. They supplement the core StoryChef system — they don't replace it.

## How to Use

1. **Read the module** for your genre (or the closest match)
2. **Copy relevant sections** into your project's CLAUDE.md or `notes/editorial-guide.md`
3. **Customize** — these are starting points, not rigid prescriptions
4. **Do deep research** for your specific niche using `templates/genre-research-prompt.md`

## Available Modules

| Module | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| `memoir.md` | Personal narrative, life stories, autobiographical writing |
| `fiction.md` | Novels and short stories (literary or genre) |
| `creative-nonfiction.md` | Personal essays, narrative journalism, hybrid forms |

## What's NOT Here

These modules cover broad genres. Your specific project is more specific than any of these. A tragicomic divorce memoir is different from a coming-of-age immigrant memoir is different from a war memoir. A cozy mystery is different from a psychological thriller is different from literary horror.

The genre research prompt template (`templates/genre-research-prompt.md`) exists precisely for this reason. Use it to go deep on your exact niche, then distill what you learn into your project's editorial guide.

## Missing Your Genre?

If you're working in a genre not covered here (poetry, screenwriting, graphic novel, etc.), you can:

1. Use the closest module as a starting point
2. Run the genre research prompt for your specific form
3. Build your editorial guide from the research
4. Consider contributing a new genre module back to the project
