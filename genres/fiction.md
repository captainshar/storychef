# Genre Module: Fiction

## The Core Distinction

Fiction interviews are different from memoir interviews. You're not excavating what happened — you're helping the author discover what COULD happen, what SHOULD happen, and what the characters WOULD do.

The author is the world-builder, the character creator, the plot architect. The interviewer helps them think through implications, find contradictions, deepen characters, and check structural integrity.

## Interview Layers

Fiction interviews move through four layers. Unlike memoir's chronological excavation, fiction interviews can jump between layers freely.

### World Layer
The container the story lives in.
- What does this place look/smell/sound/feel like?
- What's the one detail that makes it specific (not generic fantasy/city/etc.)?
- What's normal here that's strange elsewhere?
- What's the history of this place? What happened before the story starts?
- What are the rules? (Magic system, social structure, technology, physics)
- What's the gap between how this world presents itself and how it actually works?

### Character Layer
The people who inhabit the world and drive the story.
- What does [character] want RIGHT NOW? (Not their big arc goal — this scene, this moment)
- What are they afraid to admit, even to themselves?
- What do they believe that isn't true?
- How would their best friend describe them? Their enemy?
- What would they never do? (And what would make them do it anyway?)
- What do they sound like? What words would they never use?
- Why this choice and not an easier one?

### Conflict Layer
What's in the way, what's at stake, what's getting worse.
- What's the obstacle right now?
- What would make this situation worse?
- What does each character stand to lose?
- Where do two characters' wants collide?
- What's the clock? (What forces a decision?)
- What has to happen before the next scene can happen?

### Theme Layer
What the story is really about underneath the plot.
- What is this book exploring that the characters don't have language for?
- Which scenes are doing double duty (advancing plot AND exploring theme)?
- Is the theme emerging naturally from character choices, or are you forcing it?
- What's the question the book is asking? Does it need to answer it?

## Fiction-Specific Craft

### Scene Ingredients
Before drafting any scene, check that you have:

| Ingredient | Question |
|------------|----------|
| Setting | Where and when? What does the reader need to see? |
| Characters | Who's present? Who's absent but felt? |
| Conflict | What's at stake in THIS scene? |
| Emotional core | How should the reader feel? |
| Change | What's different at the end than the beginning? |
| Connection | How does this serve the book's arc? |

**If a scene doesn't change something, it probably doesn't earn its place.**

### Character Constellation
Your cast should create friction by existing in proximity:
- [ ] Each major character wants something
- [ ] At least two characters want conflicting things
- [ ] Relationships change over the course of the book
- [ ] No character exists solely to serve the protagonist's arc
- [ ] Supporting characters have lives outside the protagonist's awareness

### Plot Architecture
Choose your structural model (or let one emerge):
- **Three-act structure:** Setup, Confrontation, Resolution
- **Save the Cat beats:** 15 specific story beats
- **Hero's Journey:** Departure, Initiation, Return
- **Kishotenketsu:** Introduction, Development, Twist, Resolution (no central conflict required)
- **In medias res:** Start in the middle, fill in context
- **Braided narrative:** Multiple POVs or timelines

### Worldbuilding Tracker
For speculative fiction, fantasy, sci-fi — track your world's rules:

| Element | Rule | Established In | Consistent? |
|---------|------|----------------|-------------|
| | | | |

**Chekhov's worldbuilding:** If you establish a rule, it should matter. If it doesn't affect the plot or characters, it's decoration.

### POV and Voice
- **Whose story is this?** The POV character should be the person with the most at stake.
- **How close are we?** Deep third is different from distant third is different from first person.
- **Tense matters.** Present tense = immediacy, urgency. Past tense = reflection, control.
- **Each POV character should sound different.** If you can swap their chapters and nobody notices, the voices aren't distinct enough.

## When Stuck

**Categorical options (never specific plot suggestions):**
- Switch POV / location / time
- Escalate the current conflict
- Introduce a new complication
- Give the reader a breather (worldbuilding, character moment)
- Jump ahead and fill in later
- Go back and strengthen setup for what comes next
- Kill a darling (cut something you love but the story doesn't need)
- Ask: what's the WORST thing that could happen right now?

## Genre-Specific Considerations

Different fiction genres have different reader expectations. Use the genre research prompt to go deep on yours, but here are common ones:

**Literary fiction:** Voice and insight matter more than plot pace. Ambiguity is a feature. The "what happened" matters less than "what was understood."

**Mystery/Thriller:** Fair play with clues. Pacing is structural. The reader should be able to solve it but not easily. Red herrings need to serve double duty.

**Fantasy/Sci-Fi:** Worldbuilding serves character, not the other way around. The rules of your world create the constraints your characters push against.

**Romance:** Emotional beats are the plot. Both leads need full arcs. The "meet cute" and "dark moment" are obligatory.

**Horror:** Dread is built through what's NOT shown. Escalation needs rhythm — tension, release, more tension. The monster is always a metaphor.
