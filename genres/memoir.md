# Genre Module: Memoir

## The Core Distinction

Memoir isn't autobiography. You're not documenting everything that happened — you're finding the STORY inside what happened.

**Vivian Gornick's framework:** Every memoir has a **situation** (what happened) and a **story** (what the narrator has come to understand about what happened). If you only have situation, you have a diary. The story is what makes it a book.

## Interview Layers

Memoir interviews move through three layers. Start with Facts, go deeper to Meaning, then to Resonance. You can revisit any layer at any time.

### Facts Layer
What happened. The external record.
- What happened next?
- How old were you?
- Who else was there?
- Walk me through a typical [day/week/ritual].
- What was the sequence of events?
- What did people actually say?

### Meaning Layer
What it meant. The internal interpretation.
- What did you think that meant at the time?
- What do you see now that you couldn't then?
- What were the unspoken rules?
- What was the cost of [belief/practice]?
- Who benefited from things being this way?
- What were you taught to believe about yourself?

### Resonance Layer
How it lives in you now. The present-day impact.
- How does this show up in your life now?
- What do you feel in your body when you remember this?
- What would you tell your younger self?
- What do you wish people understood about this?
- When did you first realize this wasn't normal?
- What changed when you left / stopped believing?

## Humor Mode

Some memoirs use humor as a central tool. If your project does, toggle this on and add these questions to interviews:

- What's the most absurd part, looking back?
- Was there anything darkly funny even then?
- What's the tangent that's too good to cut?
- If your funniest friend were telling this story, what detail would they lead with?

**The humor rule:** Humor is a BUFFER for difficult truths, not deflection from them. Make light of the situation, never of the pain. The comedy comes from the accumulation of evidence, the absurd details, the gap between what was promised and what was delivered.

## Memoir-Specific Craft

### Structure Options
- **Chronological:** Start to finish, linear time
- **Thematic:** Organized by topic/lens (money, sex, religion, etc.) rather than timeline
- **Braided:** Multiple timelines or threads woven together
- **Frame:** Present-day narrator looking back, with the framing device doing work
- **Hybrid:** Mix of the above (most common in practice)

### The Two Narrators
Every memoir has two narrators:
1. **Then-narrator:** Who you were when it happened (limited understanding, in the moment)
2. **Now-narrator:** Who you are telling the story (has perspective, sees patterns)

The tension between these two is where the STORY lives. The reader watches the gap between what the then-narrator believed and what the now-narrator understands.

### Scene vs. Summary in Memoir
- **Scene:** Use for moments that changed something. Needs sensory detail, specific dialogue, a sense of being IN the moment.
- **Summary:** Use for patterns, passages of time, context. "For three years, every Sunday..."
- **Aim for 60% scene, 40% summary.** Pure scene is exhausting. Pure summary is a term paper.

### Voice Locking
Your voice is your most valuable asset. Once you find it, lock it:
1. Capture exact phrases from interviews — your natural speech patterns ARE your voice
2. Identify voice markers (wry observations, four-word summaries, understated knives, etc.)
3. Do the voice exercise: write the same passage as pure tragedy, pure comedy, then interleave

### The Wince Test
If a passage makes you want to look away, that's probably where the book needs to go. Write TOWARD shame, not away from it. The moments that are hardest to tell are usually the most important for the reader.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

For each anecdote involving real people:
- [ ] Based on your memory/perception (not claimed as objective fact)
- [ ] Focus on YOUR reaction, not diagnosis of them
- [ ] Avoid clinical labels unless professionally diagnosed
- [ ] Could pass the "is this demonstrably false?" test
- [ ] Real names changed or permission obtained

**Protective framing:**
- "I felt..." not "He was..."
- "It seemed to me..." not "He intended..."
- "What I experienced was..." not "What he did was..."

## Reference Style

Think documentary interviews — like "Shiny Happy People" or "The Vow." The interviewer draws out the story through questions, moving between facts, meaning, and present-day resonance. The subject's voice is the voice. The interviewer's job is to ask the question that unlocks the next piece.
