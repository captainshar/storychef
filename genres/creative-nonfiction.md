# Genre Module: Creative Nonfiction

## The Core Distinction

Creative nonfiction is the broadest category here. It includes personal essays, narrative journalism, lyric essays, nature writing, cultural criticism with a personal angle, and hybrid forms that resist easy labeling.

What unites them: **real material, shaped with craft.** The facts are true; the art is in selection, structure, and voice.

## Interview Layers

Creative nonfiction interviews move through three layers, distinct from memoir's. The emphasis shifts from excavating personal history toward understanding observations, building arguments, and connecting to wider meaning.

### Observation Layer
What you noticed. The raw material of attention.
- What did you actually see/hear/feel/smell?
- What's the specific detail that makes this real (not a detail that could be anywhere)?
- What surprised you?
- What did you notice that other people missed?
- What did you expect vs. what actually happened?
- Describe the scene as if you're a camera. What's in the frame?

### Argument Layer
What you're really saying. The claim underneath the story.
- What are you arguing, even if you're not writing a polemic?
- What's the insight that justifies this piece existing?
- Who would disagree with you? Why? Are they partly right?
- What's the strongest counterargument to your position?
- What evidence do you have? What's missing?
- What would change your mind?

### Connection Layer
Why this matters beyond you. The bridge to the reader.
- Why does this matter to someone who wasn't there?
- What's the universal inside the specific?
- Where does the personal become political (or vice versa)?
- What does this reveal about how things work — systems, cultures, human nature?
- What should the reader do with this information? Feel? Understand?
- What's the "so what?" and how are you answering it?

## Creative Nonfiction Craft

### Forms and Their Logic

**Personal Essay:** Your experience is the lens. The essay is about YOU thinking about something — the thinking IS the content. Structure often follows the movement of thought rather than chronology.

**Narrative Journalism:** You're telling someone else's story, or a story bigger than yourself. Your presence as narrator is a choice — how visible are you? Why?

**Lyric Essay:** Fragmented, associative, image-driven. White space does work. Juxtaposition creates meaning that linear argument can't. The reader fills in gaps.

**Cultural Criticism:** An argument about culture grounded in specific texts, events, or phenomena. The "I" is present but serving the argument, not the other way around.

**Nature/Place Writing:** The landscape is a character. Precision of observation is everything. The writer's relationship to place is the story underneath the description.

### The "So What?" Test
Every piece of creative nonfiction needs to answer this, even if it never states it directly. If the piece is about your experience, what does that experience illuminate beyond itself? If it's about a topic, what does your treatment reveal that a Wikipedia article wouldn't?

### Structure in Creative Nonfiction

Unlike fiction (which follows plot) or memoir (which follows life), creative nonfiction structure is often the most creative choice you make:

- **Segmented:** Numbered or titled sections, white space between them. Each segment is a facet; together they make a shape.
- **Braided:** Two or more strands (personal + reported, past + present, place + idea) woven together. The braid creates meaning neither strand has alone.
- **Hermit crab:** Borrowed structure from another form (recipe, field guide, FAQ, rejection letter). The borrowed form comments on the content.
- **Linear argument:** Thesis → evidence → complication → resolution. Simple but effective when the argument is strong.
- **Associative/Lyric:** Image → image → image, connected by logic that operates below the surface. Trust the reader.

### Voice in Creative Nonfiction

Voice is especially critical here because the narrator is real. The reader is trusting a real person to be honest, interesting, and worth their time.

**Ethos signals to cultivate:**
- Precision (specific details, not vague gestures)
- Self-awareness (you see your own blind spots, or at least try)
- Earned authority (you did the work, had the experience, did the research)
- Generosity (you're not writing to show off; you're writing to share something useful or true)

**Voice pitfalls to avoid:**
- The "this happened to me and therefore matters" trap — it needs to matter beyond you
- Over-explaining — trust the reader to make connections
- False modesty — if you have expertise or authority, own it
- Performing vulnerability without actually being vulnerable

### The Research Component

Many creative nonfiction pieces require research alongside personal material:
- **Track your sources** in `notes/` — interviews, articles, books, data
- **Distinguish between** what you observed, what you were told, and what you read
- **Fact-check yourself** — creative nonfiction's contract with the reader is that the facts are true
- **When you're uncertain**, say so. Uncertainty honestly acknowledged builds more trust than false confidence.

## When Stuck

**Categorical options:**
- Switch registers — if you've been analytical, try a scene; if scenic, try an idea
- Follow a tangent — the digression might BE the piece
- Jump to a different section and connect later
- Try a different form (what if this were a list? A letter? A field guide entry?)
- Ask: what am I avoiding saying?
- Ask: what does the reader need to know that I'm assuming they already know?
- Cut the first three paragraphs — the piece often really starts on page two

## Ethical Considerations

- **Living subjects:** If writing about real people, consider consent, fairness, and the power dynamic between you and your subject
- **Composite characters:** Label them. Don't present composites as individuals.
- **Scene recreation:** If reconstructing a scene from memory, be honest about the limits of recall
- **The "I" as character:** You are performing a version of yourself. Be honest about the gap between you-the-writer and you-the-character
- **Fact vs. truth:** The facts must be true. The meaning you make from them is your interpretation — own it as such
