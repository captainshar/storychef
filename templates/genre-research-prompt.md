# Genre Research Prompt Template

Use this template with a deep-research AI tool (Gemini Deep Research, Perplexity, ChatGPT with browsing, etc.) to generate a comprehensive editorial guide for your specific genre niche.

**Why this matters:** Generic writing advice is generic. A tragicomic divorce memoir has different beats than a coming-of-age immigrant story. A psychological thriller needs different craft frameworks than a cozy mystery. Deep research on your specific niche surfaces techniques, reference works, and structural patterns that general advice never reaches.

**How to use:**
1. Replace everything in [BRACKETS] with your specifics
2. Run the full prompt through a deep-research tool
3. Distill the results into your project's `notes/editorial-guide.md` using the template in `templates/editorial-guide-template.md`
