## Core Identity

**What kind of book is this?**
[Not just "memoir" or "novel" — what specific flavor? Tragicomic divorce memoir? Atmospheric literary fantasy? Sharp-edged personal essays?]

**The Balance:**
[What tensions does this book hold? Humor vs. pain? Beauty vs. horror? Personal vs. political? How should they interact?]

**Comparison Models:**
[2-3 books that occupy similar territory. What specifically do you admire about each?]

---

## Situation vs. Story

> From Vivian Gornick: **Situation** is what happened. **Story** is what you've come to understand about what happened.

**The book's STORY (not situation):**
[One sentence that captures what the book understands, not what it describes]

### Chapter/Section Story Sentences

| Chapter | Situation | Story |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| | | |

**Rule:** If you can't articulate the STORY for a section, you're not ready to write it. Go back to INTERVIEW mode.

## Structural Framework

[Which structural model(s) work for this project? Fill in whichever applies.]

**Options to consider:**
- Save the Cat beats (15 beats mapped to your chapters)
- Three-act structure
- Hero's Journey / Heroine's Journey
- Braided narrative (multiple threads)
- Thematic organization (memoir)
- Chronological with flashbacks
- Frame narrative
- Something else entirely

### Beat Map

| Beat | Your Project | Chapter/Section |

## Voice Markers

**Characteristic patterns to preserve:**
[Add these as you discover them in interviews and drafts]

-

**Voice exercise (when the writing feels flat):**
Write the same passage three ways:
1. At its most intense/serious
2. At its most detached/playful
3. Interleave the two — that's usually where your voice lives

---

## Scene vs. Summary Decision Tree

**Make it a SCENE when:**
- The moment changed something (relationship, understanding, stakes)
- There's specific sensory detail available
- Dialogue exists or can be reconstructed
- It demonstrates a pattern better than telling would

**Make it SUMMARY when:**
- It's connective tissue between scenes
- The pattern matters more than any single instance
- You don't have sensory detail
- It would slow the pacing without earning its weight

**Aim for roughly 60% scene, 40% summary.** Too much scene = exhausting. Too much summary = distancing.

## Genre-Specific Craft Notes

[Paste in relevant findings from your deep research here. What are the obligatory scenes for your genre? What do readers expect? What are the tonal techniques that work?]

---

## Legal/Ethical Notes

[If applicable — especially for memoir, creative nonfiction, or anything based on real people/events]

---

## Punch-Up Protocol

After drafting a section, do a revision pass:

1. **Find the flat passages** (pure information, no energy)
2. **Ask:** What's the specific detail that makes this vivid?
3. **Check voice consistency** against the markers above
4. **Verify the "and THEN" energy** — each beat should build, not just continue
